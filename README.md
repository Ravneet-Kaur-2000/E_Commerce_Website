<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

* This ecommerce application adopts the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern using the Express framework and MongoDB for database operations. 
* The application separates concerns effectively: Models handle data interaction via Mongoose, ensuring structured schemas for users and products; Views are rendered using EJS templates, facilitating dynamic content display and user interface elements; Controllers manage business logic and route handling, including user authentication, product management, and cart operations. 
* Authentication is managed securely with session storage, and CSRF protection is implemented to safeguard against cross-site request forgery. 
* Stripe integration provides a reliable payment gateway, supporting standard card transactions. 
* Admin capabilities include CRUD functionalities for products, enabling administrators to efficiently add, edit, and manage product listings. 
* Error handling mechanisms ensure robustness, with tailored error pages for different HTTP status codes.
